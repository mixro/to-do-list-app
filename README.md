## Overview

This frontend serves as a practical tool for managing daily tasks, offering a user-friendly interface built with **React Native** and **Expo**. It incorporates **React Navigation** for seamless navigation and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Key features include:

- Tab-based navigation for different task views.
- Task creation, editing, and deletion functionalities.
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices.
- Integration with Expo libraries for enhanced features.

## Architecture

### Components

- **React Native Application**: Constructs the mobile app with a component-driven approach.
- **React Navigation**: Facilitates tab and stack navigation between screens.
- **NativeWind**: Integrates Tailwind CSS for styling consistency.
- **Expo Libraries**: Utilizes modules like `expo-font` and `expo-haptics` for typography and user feedback.
- **API Integration**: Supports potential backend connectivity for data persistence.
- **Animations**: Leverages `react-native-reanimated` for smooth transitions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mixro/to-do-list-app
    cd to-do-list-app
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

    - Use Expo Go app on your device or select 'android', 'ios', or 'web' options.

## Component Structure
The app follows a modular component-based architecture:

- **Reusable Components**: Task list items, input forms for task creation.
- **Custom Hooks**: Potential hooks for state or API management.
- **Pages**: Tab screens for task views, edit screens for modifications.
- **Styles**: Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling.
- **Layouts**: Defined in `layout.tsx` files for navigation structure.

## Pages and Components

- **Tabs/**: Contains screens like task list and profile views.
- **edit/**: Includes components for modifying tasks.
- **task/**: Houses task creation and display logic.
- **layout.tsx**: Manages the overall navigation layout.

## Authentication

- **No Authentication**: Currently designed for personal use without login.
- **Future Integration**: Can incorporate Expo AuthSession for user accounts.

## State Management

- **Local State**: Managed within components for task data.
- **Future Enhancement**: Consider Context API or a state library for scalability.

## Testing

### Setup

Install testing dependencies (if not included):
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react-native jest
```

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

- Tests can cover component rendering and state changes.

## Deployment

### Local Build
```bash
npm run android
```
or
```bash
npm run ios
```

### Deployment

- Publish to Expo Store using `expo publish`.
- Generate standalone builds with `expo build` for distribution.

## Error Handling

- **Component Errors**: Handled with try-catch in async operations.
- **User Feedback**: Display alerts for invalid inputs or failures.
- **Global Handling**: Use Expo's error reporting for unexpected issues.

## Security

- **Data Safety**: Local task data stored securely within the app.
- **Input Validation**: Basic checks on user inputs.
- **Future Consideration**: Add encryption for sensitive data if synced.

## Future Improvements

- Implement task synchronization with a backend.
- Add notifications for task deadlines.
- Enhance UI with advanced animations.
- Integrate unit and integration tests.

## Support
For assistance, check Expo logs or contact the development team. Include device details, error logs, and steps to replicate issues.
